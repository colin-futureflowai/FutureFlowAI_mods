# futureflow

FutureFlowAI's all-in-one Claude Code mod: fewer tokens in and out, a Mac that doesn't freeze, a branded look and progress you can see.

futureflow will replace the separate `agent-slots` and `minify` plugins. Until you uninstall those, futureflow detects them at session start and leaves their parts to the old plugin, so nothing runs twice.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/FutureFlowAI_mods
claude plugin install futureflow@futureflowai-mods
# when the old plugins are installed:
claude plugin uninstall agent-slots@futureflowai-mods minify@futureflowai-mods
```

Requires Claude Code 2.1.287 or newer. State lives in `~/.claude/futureflow/` (override with `FUTUREFLOW_HOME`).
